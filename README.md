This is a 2d game wrote with pure JavaScript.

- drew the game graphics in HTML5 canvas,
- wrote modular scripts and defined classes with ECMAScript 6 style,
- leveraged vector mathematics to calculate the collision and rebounds,
- supported playing by mouse and touchscreen with pertinent event listener.

This game can be run in a web browser without any server side code,
but as CORS policy, you still need to place entire public folder on a web server,
then you are good to go.

Or you can play it from [here](https://mingjiedeng.github.io/JavaScript-game/).
Have fun!
